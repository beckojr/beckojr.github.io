**Cloud Engineer specialized in Infrastructure automation, Platform engineering, and DevOps.**

I help organizations build robust, self-service cloud platforms that reduce deployment time from days to minutes. Welcome to my personal corner of the internet where I share my work and interests in cloud computing, automation, computer networking, and software engineering.

## 🚀 About Me

I am a Cloud Engineer with a passion for **Platform Engineering**, **DevOps**, and **Infrastructure as Code**. My journey started at **Polytech' Nantes** (2017), where I specialized in Systems, Networking, and Cloud. Since then, I've been helping companies like **AXA**, **Air France**, and **Sanofi** (to list a few) modernize their infrastructures.

I am curious by nature and love exploring new topics, whether it's the latest in cloud native tech or something completely unrelated to IT.

⚽ **Fun Fact:** I am a die-hard **Real Madrid C.F** fan. _¡Hala Madrid!_
